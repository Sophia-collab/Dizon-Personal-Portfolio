	<h2><strong>About Me</strong></h2>
	<h3>I'm Sophia Ysabel Dizon</h3>
	<p> A 1st year student currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) program at Our Lady Of Fatima University.  Aspiring to become skilled programmer and acquire the knowledge that needed in my future career and become a competent member of society</p>
	<p>I’m currently diving into front-end development, with a bit of game development on the side. Whether it’s structuring and designing websites or exploring the world of game dev, I’m always excited to keep learning—especially in the ever-evolving world of technology and AI.</p>
	<p>In my free time, I often get lost in the world of gaming or occasionally dive into the pages of a good book, always with a cold chocolate drink by my side.</p>
